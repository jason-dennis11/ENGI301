## Motivation 
Do you know how to play an instrument? Well, I sure do not. Since I was in middle school, I always wanted to learn how to play an instrument and how to read music. Music theory was something I Unfortunately, I never got the opportunity to do so. As a senior in college, I decided itâ€™s time for that to change. I combined my interest in music and my love for electronics into a Laser Harp Controller that allows one to play a mixture of the notes in an octave by simply waving their hand between the lasers! I am sharing this PCB with the open source community to allow all to enjoy and maybe even build their own Laser Harp!
